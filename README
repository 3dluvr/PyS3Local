A fork of mock-s3, a python port of Fake-S3.

Updated to get it working in Py3 then possibly extending further.


INSTALL:

    python setup.py install


USE:

create a fake credentials file with something like:

    AWSAccessKeyId=12345
    AWSSecretKey=12345

set the env variable before running examples, so boto can find it and use it:

    export AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE="<path/to/fake_credentials>"

start the server in another window

    python PyS3Local/main.py

then

    cd examples

and run some examples...
